# Project-L-CTF
For my something awesome project, I decided to recreate some of the challenges that inspired me on HACKTHEOX, such as File Upload, Command Injection, and Symlink Attack. To complete the challenge, participants will need to set it up on Docker and run it locally.

Please read the **Quick guide to setup ctf challenge.pdf** to setup the challenge

Main objective: Read the secret file contains flag. (Flag format: FLAG{...})
